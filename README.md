# WolfWhisper

WolfWhisper is a chat application created during an academic project. It was builed using two principal tools; Django to manage the server technology and JavaScript for the client one.
the application gives access after connection or creation of an account if it is the first use, then the creation of a room or the possibility of joining a created one if you already got its name, and finally its main role is to allow the chat between 2 or more people.
